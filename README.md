Shadows are mostly non corporeal and cannot lift carry or move corporeal objects. A shadows non-corporeal nature’s means it takes half damage from physical attacks, though it takes full damage from magic or enchanted weapons. They attack by draining ST from living beings. Their attacks ignore non magic armor. 

Shadows attack for 1d-1 ST. Damage is temporary, as per Wizard fatigue. A figure reduced to 0 ST by a shadow becomes a shadow!
