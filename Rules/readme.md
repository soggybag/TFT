# Rules 

## Character Creation

Characters have three attributes: 

- ST - Strength
- DX - Dexterity
- IQ - Intelligence

Each starts with 8 points. Divide 12 more points between these to create a starting character. 

## Equipping Character

Choose any two weapons, a shield counts as a weapon, and a dagger. Choose any armor.
